/**
 * Service worker registration, and the update policy that makes it deliverable.
 *
 * Caching is the easy half. Delivery is the hard half: an installed iOS web app
 * resumed from the app switcher does not navigate, so the browser never rechecks
 * `sw.js`, and a worker that installed and went to `waiting` can sit there
 * unactivated for weeks. An app resumed daily could check for updates zero times.
 *
 * So: look for an update when the app comes back to the foreground, and activate as
 * soon as activating cannot lose anything. The reload that follows is
 * indistinguishable from a cold launch, which is what returning to the app looks
 * like anyway — but never while a task is half-typed or a write is in flight.
